    "ingredients": "- 1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar\n- 2 tablespoons mushroom seasoning powder or 1 vegan instant ramen seasoning packet \n- 1 pound moderately spicy fresh red chilies, such as Korean, Fresno or ripe jalapeño\n- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n- 1/2  medium pumpkin or kabocha (about 1½ pounds), seeds scraped out and skin left on \n- 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n- 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste\n- freshly ground black pepper\n- 1/4 cup finely chopped garlic (about 12 cloves)\n- 2 teaspoons mushroom seasoning powder or 1 vegan instant ramen seasoning packet\n- 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n- 1 pound greens (pea leaves, baby spinach, kale or green of your choice), about 16 cups loosely packed\n- 3 ounces ramen noodles, fresh or dried\n- 2 tablespoons Charred Red Chili Paste (recipe above) or hot sauce of your choice\n- 2 tablespoons roasted salted pumpkin seeds (optional)\n- 2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seed oil (optional)",
    "steps": "- <strong>For the charred red chili paste:</strong>\n- 1. Stir together the vinegar and mushroom seasoning powder in a small mixing bowl.\n- 2. Position an oven rack about 4 inches from the broiler and preheat the broiler. Put the chilies on a sheet pan, drizzle with the oil and toss well to coat them. Arrange them in a single layer and broil, turning over the chilies once about halfway through, until they're blistered and blackened, 8 to 10 minutes. Let them cool a bit.\n- 3. Pull the stems off the chilies but don't deseed them or remove the skins. Add the chilies to a food processor and pulse until fairly finely chopped, then add the vinegar mixture and pulse until well mixed but still a little chunky. It keeps in the fridge for up to 1 month.\n- <strong>For the pumpkin ramen:</strong>\n- 1. Preheat oven to 375 F.\n- 2. Drizzle pumpkin with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place pumpkin on a baking sheet, cut-side down, and roast until very soft, about 45 minutes.\n- 3. Combine the garlic and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a medium pot, set it over medium-high heat and let it sizzle. Cook, stirring, until it's fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Scrape the pumpkin or squash from the skin, add to the pot, use a spoon to break it into smallish pieces and turn the heat to high. Once it sizzles, cook, stirring occasionally, for a minute, then stir in 8 cups water along with the salt, mushroom seasoning powder and soy sauce.\n- 4. Let it come to a boil, skim off some of the froth, then add the greens in several batches, stirring after each batch to wilt. Stir in the ramen noodles. Cook at a boil, stirring occasionally, until the greens' stems are tender but still have some texture and the noodles are al dente, about 3 minutes. Season with salt.\n- <strong>To serve:</strong>\n- Transfer to a large serving bowl and top with the chili paste or hot sauce and, if using, pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil. Serve right away.",
