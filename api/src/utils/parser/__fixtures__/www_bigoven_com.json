    "steps": "- 1.  Rinse strawberries and cut around the top of the strawberry.  Remove the top and clean out with a paring knife, if necessary (some may already be hallow inside).  Prep all strawberries and set aside.   2.  In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla until creamy.  Add cream cheese mix to a piping bag or a ziplock bag with the corner snipped off.  Fill strawberries with cheesecake mixture.  Once strawberries are filled, dip the top in graham cracker crumbs.  If not serving immediately, refrigerate until serving.",
