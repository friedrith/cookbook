# Squid game

A Web game based on green light/red light game from the famouse Squid Game TV show.

This web app uses [React v17](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com) and the set of icons [Lordicons](https://cdn.lordicon.com/libs/mssddfmo/lord-icon-2.1.0.js). The goal of this web app was to create a motion detector using the webcam/front camera and implementing an app with as less dependencies as possible while keeping it very pretty and user-friendly.

React and more specifically the principle of hooks was nice to use. The Lord icon set was very useful to insert animated icons.
