    "ingredients": "- 1 cup (5 ounces or 140 grams) sesame seeds, we prefer hulled\n- 2 to 4 tablespoons neutral flavored oil such as grape seed, vegetable or a light olive oil\n- Pinch of salt, optional",
    "steps": "- Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly until the seeds become fragrant and very lightly colored (not brown), 3 to 5 minutes. Careful here, sesame seeds can burn quickly.\n- Transfer toasted seeds to a baking sheet or large plate and cool completely.\n- Add sesame seeds to the bowl of a food processor then process until a crumbly paste, about 1 minute.\n- Add 3 tablespoons of the oil then process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of the food processor a couple of times. Check the tahini&#8217;s consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty, and should be pourable. You may need to process for another minute or add the additional tablespoon of oil.\n- Taste the tahini for seasoning then add salt to taste. Process 5 to 10 seconds to mix it in.\n- Store tahini covered in the refrigerator for one month. You may notice it separates over time, like a natural peanut butter would. If this happens, give the tahini a good stir before using.",
